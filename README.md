This is  a 3-tier architecture of AWS. The 3-tier architecture typically consists of the following layers:
Presentation Layer (Web Tier): Handles user interactions. This layer consists of an Load Balancer (LB) distributing traffic to EC2 instances running web servers.
Application Layer (App Tier): Hosts the application logic. This layer uses EC2 instances running the application behind another LB or an auto-scaling group.
Data Layer (Database Tier): Manages the data storage. This layer typically uses an RDS (Relational Database Service) instance for database management.
Components
1. VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
Custom VPC with public and private subnets spread across multiple Availability Zones for high availability.
Public subnets for the web tier and NAT gateways.
Private subnets for the application and database tiers.
2. Internet Gateway & NAT Gateway
Internet Gateway attached to the VPC for internet access for resources in public subnets.
NAT Gateway in the public subnet to allow instances in private subnets to access the internet securely.
3. Load Balancer 
Web Tier LB: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances in the web tier.
App Tier LB: Distributes traffic from the web tier to the application tier.
4. EC2 Instances
Web Tier: EC2 instances running a web server (e.g., Ubuntu, AWS linux).
App Tier: EC2 instances running the application code.
5. Auto Scaling Groups
Configured for the web and application tiers to ensure high availability and scalability.
6. RDS (Relational Database Service)
Amazon RDS for database management in the data layer.
Multi-AZ deployment for high availability.
7. Security Groups
Security groups configured to allow appropriate traffic between tiers and from the internet.
Best practices for least privilege and only required ports open.
8. Route Tables
Public route tables associated with public subnets.
Private route tables associated with private subnets.
